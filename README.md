# Employee Sales Filter using Delegates in C#

This project demonstrates the concept of **Delegates** in C# by filtering and displaying employee sales data based on custom conditions.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Employee.cs`: Defines the `Employee` class with basic properties(Id, Name, Gender, TotalSales).
- `Report.cs`: Contains the `Report` class with a method that processes employee data using delegates.
- `Program.cs`: Entry point of the application where employees are initialized and filtered.

## üß† Concept

The project uses **Delegates** to pass different filtering logic for processing employee records. 
This improves **reusability**, **flexibility**, and follows **Open/Closed Principle** from SOLID design principles.
